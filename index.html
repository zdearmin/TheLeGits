            <h3>Mary DiGITal</h3>
            <p>Foul-mouthed and slightly dull-witted, this peer fakes it until they make it. Their strengths include creating charismatic conversation, making decent coffee, and communicating with animals. Their weaknesses are the short-term memory loss that plagues their oblivious mind, their inability to be punctual, and their fervent dibelief that dragonns actually exist. There name is in no way correlated with their character, only with the assumtion that it sounded cool in the current project. :)  </p>
